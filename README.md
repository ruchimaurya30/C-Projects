Each project focuses on different aspects of C++ programming.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game.
In this game, each player takes turns placing Xs and Os on a 3×3 board, with the goal of getting three of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The game is won when a player gets three in a row, and it is a draw if the board is filled up without either player achieving that.
The game board in Tic-Tac-Toe Project is represented by a two-dimensional array, and players engage in gameplay by entering moves into the console.
If the move is valid, the game will then check the board to see if it is, and if so, it will switch turns between the two players.
When one player collects three consecutive wins, or when the board is entirely filled, the game is over.

Bus Reservation System-
This Bus reservation system offers different features to the users such as viewing routes and buses and allows them to book tickets and cancel them if required.
After registration, passengers can make reservations by specifying the bus number, route and selecting an available seat. 
The system checks the seat’s availability and records the passenger’s name. Here you can check that which seat is available.
Administrators can view reservations for a specific bus by entering its number. 
The system displays the bus details, seat matrix, and the names of passengers who have made reservations.
A graceful exit option allows users to conclude their interaction with the system.
